| Overview[1] |   | A
  web mapping platform that's versatile through configuration and open for
  custom tool development.  Ideal for fit
  for purpose applications, both desktop and mobile.  Can be light weight or heavy weight
  depending on clients needs. |   | ESRI's
  extension of ArcGIS into the cloud, ArcGIS Online provides a space to develop
  applications and share apps and contents for purposes of collaboration.  A potential alternative to the DMF with its
  application templates, but some still have that GIS feel. |   | Leaflet
  based toolkit allowing for contanerized deployments that are light
  weight.  Targeted to non-GIS
  developers. |   | The
  perfect platform for map within an app transactional builds that need to be
  integrated into a larger click-through system.  Architecture is complex |
| Overview Alternative |   | A
  web mapping platform which is the built upon the ESRI GeoCortex
  platform.  This is a DataBC product
  which provides maps and reports from the BC Geographic Warehouse. Ideal for
  either mobile or desktop as is or with additional development.   |   | The
  official BC Government location for ESRI's ArcGIS Online (AGOL) tool. It is a
  cloud-based tool which allows a user to develop applications and share
  geospatial information. Useful to link GIS Analyst work with Business users
  to share maps and reports.  |   | Leaflet
  based toolkit allowing for deployments that are light weight.  Useful for non-GIS developers who are
  building in the Agile environment. |   | This
  NRM service is part of Common Services tools which provides an Open Source
  framework for building a map within an application.  The CWM Client can be added to host
  application web pages to display and interact with maps and spatial
  data.  |
| Primary Strengths |   | All
  purpose Web Mapping Framework focusing on fit for purpose application

    Custom tools, workflows and reports can be developed to extend an
  application

    Mobile support through phone and tabloid

    Light or heavy weight implementations |   | Simple
  applications that can be built and shared with groups, a ministry, government
  or public

    Hundreds of default templates to choose from including story books

    ArcGIS Online collector for quick, simple field data collection

    Elastic server architecture for high, short term use applications

    Integration with Location Service APIs |   | Container

    Lightweight, API based

    Non-GIS Developers

    Direct system integration

    3D option |   | The
  NRM Common Web Mapping (CWM) framework provides a simple, powerful and
  lightweight mapping capability for web-browser based client applications. CWM
  is integrated with the NRS ISSS service-based architecture.  The client component provides a simple API
  to let host pages interact with the map to display and manipulate spatial
  data.  |

    JS 4x viewer upgrade (future) |   | Continued
  vigilance on data governance and content publication

    Essentials workflows |   | Positioned
  as light weight points on a map replacement for DMF.
